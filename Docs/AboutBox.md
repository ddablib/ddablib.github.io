# About Box Component Documentation

## Introduction

This is the home page for the on-line documentation of the DelphiDabbler [About Box Component](https://delphidabbler.com/software/aboutbox) project.

This project contains one unit - _PJAbout_ that implements a single non-visual component, [_TPJAboutBoxDlg_](./AboutBox/API/TPJAboutBoxDlg.md), that encapsulates an "About" dialogue box.

The component is believed to compile on all versions of Delphi back to Delphi 2, but the latest version has been tested only on Delphi 7 and Delphi 2007 through to XE3. This is a Windows-only component that requires the VCL. It is not compatible with FireMonkey. Delphi 1 support was dropped as at v3.5.

**This documentation applies to the About Box Component v3.6 and later.**

> Documentation for earlier versions is no longer available.
