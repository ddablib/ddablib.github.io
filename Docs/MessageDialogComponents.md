# Message Dialogue Components #

The Message Dialogue Components are supplied in a single unit named _PJMessageDialog_. There are two components:

| **Class** | **Description** |
|:----------|:----------------|
| _[TPJWinMsgDlg](TPJWinMsgDlg.md)_ | This component wraps the Windows _MessageBoxIndirect_ API call and displays a message box based on that provided by Windows. This component will be suitable for most purposes and has the lighter footprint. |
| _[TPJVCLMsgDlg](TPJVCLMsgDlg.md)_  | This component uses the Delphi VCL _CreateMessageDialog_  function to create a form based message box. The component provides more flexibility than either the Delphi functions or _[TPJWinMsgDlg](TPJWinMsgDlg.md)_. It should be used when it is necessary to display buttons or combinations of buttons that are not supported by the Windows API message box or when a finer degree of control over the appearance and behaviour of the message box is required. _TPJVCLMsgDlg_ supports all the features of _[TPJWinMsgDlg](TPJWinMsgDlg.md)_ and extends them. The dialogue box component's form can been customised by handling the _[OnShow](TPJVCLMsgDlgOnShow.md)_ and _[OnHide](TPJVCLMsgDlgOnHide.md)_ events. |

**Note:** This documentation applies to release 3.0.0 and later. Earlier versions had an additional component named _TPJMessageDialog_ that was deprecated in later v2 releases and removed at v3.
