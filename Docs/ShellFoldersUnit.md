# Shell Folders Unit

Two units are actually provided: _PJShellFolders_ and _PJShellFoldersDsgn_.

## PJShellFolders

This unit provides components, classes and routines to assist in working with shell folders. There are two components:

* _[TPJSpecialFolderInfo](TPJSpecialFolderInfo.md)_ - provides information about the Shell's various special folders.
* _[TPJBrowseDialog](TPJBrowseDialog.md)_ - provides access to the Browse for Folder dialog box.

There is also a class - _[TPJSpecialFolderEnum](TPJSpecialFolderEnum.md)_ that enumerates the shell's special folder identifiers. This class implements the _[IPJSpecialFolderEnum](IPJSpecialFolderEnum.md)_ interface. Functions that provide information about the special folder identifiers and symbolic constants are also provided.

_PJShellFolders_ also provides [functions](PJShellFoldersFunctions.md) to provide information about the folders described by PIDLs.

## PJShellFoldersDsgn

This unit provides design time support. In particular it provides a property editor for _[TPJBrowseDialog](TPJBrowseDialog.md)_ and _[TPJSpecialFolderInfo](TPJSpecialFolderInfo.md)_ that allows predefined special folder IDs to be selected in the object inspector.
