# [Console Application Runner Classes](../ConsoleApp.md) Programmers Guide

## Introduction

This section of the Console Application Runner Classes documentation focuses on describing the classes, methods properties and events that make up the library.

Any feature that was introduced later than v3.0 will be marked with the version number at which the feature was first made available. An example is: [v3.1].
