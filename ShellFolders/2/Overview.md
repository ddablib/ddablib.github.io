# [Shell Folders Unit](../index.md) Overview

**Applies to:** ~>2.0

> This page provides an overview of the features of the Shell Folders Unit. If you are looking for information on programming with the unit please see the [Programmers' Guide](./API.md).

The _Shell Folders Unit_ provides various components, classes and routines for handling Windows shell folders. It contains:

* A component that provides information about a specified special shell folder.
* A class that enumerates all the special shell folders.
* Routines to manipulate special shell folder information.
* A component that encapsulates the Windows Browse for Folder dialogue box.

There is a second unit that provides Delphi IDE design time support. It registers the components and provides a property editor that enumerates special shell folder identifiers.

## Compatibility

The components can be compiled with any Delphi compiler from Delphi 7 through to 11.3. They are compatible with 32 bit and 64 bit Windows targets.

It is possible that the components will compile with Delphi 4 to 6, but this has not been tested.

The _Shell Folders Unit_ requires the VCL, so is not compatible with the FireMonkey framework.

Non-Windows platforms are not supported.
