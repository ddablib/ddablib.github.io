# [MD5 Message Digest Unit](../MD5.md) Overview

This unit contains an implementation of the MD5 message digest algorithm.

The code has been developed from scratch based on the algorithm presented in [RFC 1321](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html). Portions of the code are translated from the reference C code supplied in the RFC. However the code is ***not*** a literal translation into Pascal from the reference C code.

[DUnit](http://dunit.sourceforge.net/) tests are provided with the source code to help you test the code's accuracy. The tests include those specified in [RFC 1321](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html).
