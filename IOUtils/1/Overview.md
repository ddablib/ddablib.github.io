# [I/O Utility Classes](../IOUtils.md) Overview

> This page provides an overview of the features of the I/O Utility Classes. If you are looking for information on programming with the classes please see the [Programmers' Guide](./API.md).

These classes are designed to assist in various I/O related tasks. Classes are provided to:

* Simplify the opening of files in various different modes with specified security attributes and to provide access to the file handle.
* Simplify working with un-named pipes.
* Handle the formatting of data read from pipes, for example reading Unicode strings.

All the classes are compatible with the Delphi 7 and later 32 bit Windows compiler and the Delphi XE2 and later 64 bit Windows compiler.

Non-Windows targets are not supported.

> Versions of these classes were originally included with the [Console Application Runner Classes](../ConsoleApp.md) project v2, but were moved to this project as of 21 March 2013 and removed from Console Application Runner Classes v3.
