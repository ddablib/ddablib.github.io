# ddablib.github.io

This project contains the source code of the [DelphiDabbler Code Library](https://github.com/ddablib) (ddablib) documentation website.

## ALPHA CODE

This project is based on [delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs](https://github.com/delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs) and was copied from that project on 2022-09-06. All the `ddab-lib-docs` history was brought forward.

This site is early in development at present and is being restructured. All page URLs are in the process of being changed.

You are advised to continue to use the original documentation at [delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs](https://github.com/delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs) for the time being.

The site has a custom URL: [https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com/](https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com/).

> The GitHub Pages URL, [https://ddablib.github.io](https://ddablib.github.io), is also valid, but simply redirects to the custom URL.
