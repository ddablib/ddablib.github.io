# ddablib.github.io

This project contains the source code of the _ddablib_ DelphiDabbler Code Library documentation website.

The site has a custom URL: [https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com/](https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com/).

> The GitHub Pages URL, [https://ddablib.github.io](https://ddablib.github.io), is also valid, but shouldn't be used. It simply redirects to the custom URL.
