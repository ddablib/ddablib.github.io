# ddablib.github.io

This project contains the source code of the _ddablib_ DelphiDabbler Code Library documentation website.

The site has a custom URL: [https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com/](https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com/).

> The GitHub Pages URL, [https://ddablib.github.io](https://ddablib.github.io), is also valid, but shouldn't be used. It simply redirects to the custom URL.

## &alpha; Code

This site is early in development at present and is being restructured. Many page URLs are in the process of being changed.

The project is based on [delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs](https://github.com/delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs) and was copied from that project on 2022-09-06. All the `ddab-lib-docs` history was brought forward.
