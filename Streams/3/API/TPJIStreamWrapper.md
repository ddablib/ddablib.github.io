# TPJIStreamWrapper class

***Project:*** [Stream Extension Classes](../API.md)

***Unit:*** [_PJIStreams_](./PJIStreams.md)

## Description

This class can wrap any _TStream_ derived class and provide access to it by means of an _IStream_ interface.

This class is similar to Delphi's _TStreamAdapter_ class, except in the way it handles the _Stat_ method. Sub-classes of _TPJIStreamWrapper_ can override _Stat_ to provide more meaningful information.

Not all features of _IStream_ are supported in this implementation. Those that are not supported are noted in this documentation.

> Study the source code of the IStreamWrapDemo demo program to see this class, and those derived from it, in use.

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [_Clone_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Clone.md) | Method of _IStream_. Creates a new _IStream_ object that accesses the same physical stream. ***Not supported in this implementation***. |
| [_Commit_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Commit.md) | Method of _IStream_. Commits pending changes. |
| [_CopyTo_](TPJIStreamWrapper-CopyTo.md) | Method of _IStream_. Copies data from the wrapped stream into another stream. |
| [_Create_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Create.md) | Object constructor. Creates a new wrapper object for a given stream. |
| [_LockRegion_](TPJIStreamWrapper-LockRegion.md) | Method of _IStream_. Restricts access to a specified range of bytes in the stream. ***Not supported in this implementation***. |
| [_Read_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Read.md) | Method of _IStream_. Reads data from the wrapped stream. |
| [_Revert_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Revert.md) | Method of _IStream_. Discards un-committed changes in a transacted stream. |
| [_Seek_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Seek.md) | Method of _IStream_. Changes the seek pointer to a new location. |
| [_SetSize_](TPJIStreamWrapper-SetSize.md) | Method of _IStream_. Changes the size of the stream. |
| [_Stat_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Stat.md) | Method of _IStream_. Retrieves the _TStatStg_ structure that provides information about the wrapped stream. |
| [_UnlockRegion_](TPJIStreamWrapper-UnlockRegion.md) | Method of _IStream_. Removes access restrictions from a range of bytes in the stream. ***Not supported in this implementation***. |
| [_Write_](TPJIStreamWrapper-Write.md) | Method of _IStream_. Writes data to the wrapped stream. |

> **Note:**
>
> **[v3.0]** Note that the methods of _IStream_ have protected visibility in _TPJIStreamWrapper_ and cannot be accessed from an object instance referenced by a variable of type _TPJIStreamWrapper_. The methods can only be accessed via the object's _IStream_ interface.
>
> **[â‰¥v3.1]** Methods of _IStream_ have public visibility.
