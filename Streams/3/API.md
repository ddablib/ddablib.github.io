# [Stream Extension Classes](../Streams.md) Programmers' Guide

## Introduction

This section of the Stream Extension Classes documentation focusses on describing the classes, methods, properties etc. that make up the library.

This documentation relates to v3 of the project.

> Documentation of earlier versions is not available.

## Contents

The guide has the following main sections. Each section provides links to more detailed information.

* [Units](./API/Units.md)
* [Classes](./API/Classes.md)

## Conventions

Identifiers in links appear like this: [_Identifier_](#conventions)

Values and in-line code appear like this:

* `42`
* `'text'`
* `True`
* `X := 42;`

Declarations and source code examples appear syntax highlighted like this:

```pascal
procedure Foo(const Bar: string);
```

Some items or statements relate only to certain versions of the project. Such items will have markers to make this clear. Examples of these markers are:

* **[v3.0]** -- Indicates that the item applies only to a given version, in this case v3.0.

* **[â‰¥v3.1]** -- Shows that the item relates to a given version and later, in this case versions from v3.1 onwards.

* **[<v3.3]** -- Shows that the item relates to versions earlier than the given version, down to v3.0. In this case, versions from v3.0 up to but not including v3.3.

> Note that, because these documents apply only to v3.0 and up, none of these markers should be read as relating to versions earlier than v3.0.
